Automatic 
=========
After doing something a few times, it becomes automatic.

### Example 1
Think about typing.  Many words you type are automatic.
Can you tell me if if the 'o' is right or left of 'w' on the keyboard?
Not quickly. But your fingers know. Think 'a' and they will hit the key.

It is automatic.

    You are not thinking about the keys, just the letters/word you want.
    
### Example 2
Steering a bike.

    In this case you are not even thinking 'left and right' but 'stay upright'.

### Example 3
Reach-and-grab.

### Muscle Memory
Obviously muscles don't have memory, so what is going on?

Simplification
==============

##### Brainstorming tangent time...
Can this be the same algorithm as deduction? collapsing ideas into nodes
and stringing them together into longer chains, then collapsing them into
a single node again?

For example, a page in my notebook shows the breakdown of the steps
required for me to get from my bedroom at college to the engineering lab.
It involved steps like unlocking my bike and putting on a helmet.
However, the whole process is collapsed in my mind to simple "going to lab".

Obviously some of those steps must be performed mentally (not automatic), 
but for thinking/planning purposes I skipped from A to Z:
(from present state to end result).

This muscle memory seems similar.  I just think of the end goal.
The difference is: the steps inbetween A and Z are (usually) performed 
automatically in muscle memory; instead of explicitly, like my traveling
example requires.

So when can we perform things automatically instead of explicitly?
IE. when is a task so familiar that it can be dropped from the high level
cognitive process to a low level automatic one?

This brings us back to the analogy of the trails (connection strengths):

    If the way forward is obvious, we don't need to ask the high
    level thread for help.
    
    Again, if there are no forks in the trail, we don't need to ask
    the high level thread to make a decision.
    
Which is a new job is so challenging: Your low level thread is
almost entirely useless. All tasks get routed through the high
level thread, meaning it can not keep its sights on the end (primary) goal.
More specifically, tiny tasks that it should not need to concentrate on
are taking its precious concentration time.  

    The High and Low level threads may run simultaneously.
    But there is only one high level thread. 

### Conclusion
If we repeat the same action *the same way* over and over, then 
we train the low level to do it.

If we perform the same goal two different ways. Being inconsistent
with our method.  Then the low level will always require direction
from the high level thread.

    Perfect practice makes perfect.

However, the low level thread may *guess or interpolate* between multiple options automatically.

Successful example, balancing a bike.  We don't try every possible handlebar angle.
But the low level gets the idea and performs correctly.  

Unsuccessful example, up and new line.  In vim, there are two ways to make a line above.
I use both equally as often.  So if I'm not paying attention, I will perform both,
creating a new line *two* spaces above.

Semi-successful example, playing piano.  When practicing a new section, there comes
a time when you must put both hands together and go for it.  Too much is happening at once
for your high level brain to manage it all.  So you hope you practiced enough to make
both hands automatic.  But that is rare, so you give permission to low level brain to
just hit the first notes it wants to.  And correct the major mistakes after two hands together
becomes mostly automatic.

    We can give low-level permission to guess.
    When  guesses correctly, then we can leave it.  
    Repeat it, and it will train itself correctly.

One more example of giving low level permission to guess: driving on the highway.
We can tell our low level brain to stay on the main highway and avoid other cars.
It will ignore exits, etc.

    Somehow the high level brain sets the threshold and subjects
    for when the low level should inform it to pay attention.
    I'm guessing guys leave their threshold pretty high.
