Train of Thought
================

    There is only one train of thought.
    It switches between reality and imagination.
    
This is the high level mental process.



### Is the train of thought composed of more than just words?

Yes.  Think of moving your hand.  You don't think in words. 
You just issue a command to move your hand to a certain location
or to perform a certain task, and the subconscious level performs
it.  This only works of the subconscious brain has been trained
repeatedly to perform the task.
