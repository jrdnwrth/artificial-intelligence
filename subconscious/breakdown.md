Subconsciousness Breakdown
==========================
1. High Brain
2. Low Brain(s)
3. Hardwired Reactions

High Brain
==========
* "Train of Thought"
* Only ever one thread
* Highest level cognitive function
* Makes new decisions.
* Sends commands to the Low Brain
* Receives interrupts from the Low Brain(s) to make decisions when needed.
* Trains the low brain to perform new tasks via consistent repetition
* Sets the level of interest to ignore/filter Low Brain(s) feedback.
* Sets whether to wait for feedback from the high brain
    * Ok this might not be true, but read the 'Baby catching' example below to decide.


Low Brain
=========
* Fast and Intuitive
* May execute a well-practiced action when instructed by the High Brain.
* Run behind the scenes (parallel to the high brain) unless the way forward is unclear.
* May interpolate, extrapolate, overlay, the tasks it knows- In order to reach a goal (1). 
* Multiple low-brains may run in parallel.(2)

Hard Wired Reactions
====================
Breathing, Blinking. And probably many others.
Some things are under our control, but we didn't need to 
train our low-brain to perform them.  They come built in.
So this isn't cheating.

Intuition
=========
TODO: Place the example of hitting the 'z' key on the keyboard.
It shows how the low-brain may even know things the high-brain has forgotten.
(Like the location of the 'z' key).  Which leads to a discussion about
intuition.  It may also be the reason why QuiGon's advice actually works
on occasion: "Feel...don't think.  - Use your instincts."

Can this be applied to more than what is considered "muscle memory"?
I am pretty sure it can. Just not sure how yet.

Notes
=====
Note 1: For example, your hand may grab an object at an angle you've never practiced before.

Note 2: For example, you can open the door and turn on turn off the light *at the same time*.
One hand gets the light while the other gets the door.  If one hand misses, it 
will send an interrupt to the high brain to look down at the knob so it can correct its position.

### Low Brain Example: Mom catching a baby.
Mom's high level brain instructs the low level brain to keep
the baby from falling at all costs.  This low-level brain 
will run the entire time the baby is in a precarious position.

Notice that this was assigned ahead-of-time.  Also notice that
the threshold for the low-brain to run autonomously was set to 
maximum freedom. Basically saying, don't ask questions, just catch
the baby.  It will not send any interrupts to the high level brain
asking for direction.

### Conclusion
There must be two thresholds:
1. When to interrupt (steal attention from) the high brain.
2. When to *wait* for directions from the high brain.
