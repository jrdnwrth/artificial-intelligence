1. For example, ask someone to draw a crowd:  You will get a bunch of stick people.  With just heads in the back rows.
1. Ask someone to draw a person: You may get a stick person with the addition of a shirt and pants and smiley face.
1. Ask them to draw a face: ears, nose, and hair may be added to the face.
