Memory Storage
==============

###What determines the rate at which a memory fades?

Fade-rate is determined by these factors:

1. Emotion
    * How emotionally/mentally stimulate are we when this input arrives?
    * Note: this is different than whether or not we actually *want* to remember.

1. Replay
    * Mentally 're-living' a memory will engrain it. But with two possible side effects:
        1. Remembering it *incorrectly* will alter the correct memory.
        2. Any details that were *not* 're-lived' will be more easily passed by the second time.
    * I envision it as re-energizing a fading pathway.
1. Uniqueness
    * If a memory falls in a unique location in the memory hash (same as sensory hash), then retain in longer.
    * I am adding this one on my own.  Without it I am affraid that unique memories will be deleted to often.

1. Complexity
    1. Remembering the weather outside is easy.
        * Probably because it is heavily sensory input.
        * And we distil it into simple emotions: dark or bright. Warm or cold.
    1. Remembering an abstract formula is difficult.
        * Assuming we did not nail it to story or image, but left it abstract.
        * Try to remembering how to tie your shoes.
            * A story about a rabit and a hole will help.
            * Or 4 simplified images of the process is much easier.
            * (Until it becomes muscle memory)
    1. Creating a visualization for a formula helps us remember it.
