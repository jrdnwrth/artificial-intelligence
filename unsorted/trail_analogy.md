This is an analogy  
==================
    It may be used to describe different mental processes.
    Here are three variations:

Neural Nets
===========
The typical picture of connected neurons.  
Some have strong connection, some have weak.

Memory
======
My early AI program which recorded its memory as
a 3D graph of its experiences.  

The end goal being that re-played experiences
would strengthen the connections.  Strong connections
last longer and are remembered.  Nearby connections
can be used to anticipate the outcome of current circumstances.

Thought Process
==============

I travel the woods frequently for all my daily tasks.

Routes I travel frequently have deep paths.

Deeper paths are easier to follow.

I can task my auto-pilot with following the main path.
(low level cognitive tasked with navigation)

However, if my path diverged in the woods,
then the low-level thread would ask the high-level which to take.
