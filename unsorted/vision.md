Vision
======

    Vision may not be needed for developing an AI.  Keep this in mind.

Keep it Simple
==============

    Concentrate resolution on the center.  Loose resolution around the periferal.
    Process all 2D into 3D *before* submitting it as an input to the AI.


Libraries
=========

    [LSD SLAM](http://vision.in.tum.de/research/vslam/lsdslam) is the best I have seen.

Low Level
=========

    Most of this is low level, subconscious processes.  Such as converting 2D images into 3D sensory input.
