Teaching Methods
================
Good teaching techniques should tell us how we learn.


The Feynman Technique
=====================

TODO: Study this technique.  Uncover what it tells us about how we learn.  And how we think.


Learning Styles
===============

According to Psychological Science in the Public Interest:
"Students may have preferences for how they learn, but teaching to those preferences *does not result in better learning.*"

From what I remember about this article, Math is best taught visually, and language is best taught verbally.  Or something like that.

My take-away from this article was simply not to worry about creating a variety of AI.  But I would not put much faith in the article being completely accurate.
