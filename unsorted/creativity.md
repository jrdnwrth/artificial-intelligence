Creativity
==========

Creativity is a motivator.  For me, I can only go so long without creating something that I can be proud of.
I need to be able to step back, look at it, and say, "I made this." and "It is good. (I'm pleased with it)"

This is a pretty clear echo to being make in the image (or nature) of our creator.

### Does everyone share this drive?
Yes.  The trick is to recognize the variation of activities which are considered creative. 
Lets come up with a definition

### Define creative
I'm defining it very broadly.  There may be a time to come back and 
clarify between "artistic", and "creative".  

All of these fall under 'creative':
* Constructive
* "To Make"
* 

##### Some unexpected examples:
* Working out.
    * Achieving better times.  Building muscle.  Lifting more. Climbing higher.
    * I don't think this counts as creativity if you are just maintaining.
* Learning new things?
    * I'm not sure this counts.  Unless you are able to demonstrate it.  
      It needs to feel concrete.
