Music
=====

    Music still does not make much sense to me, but here are my thoughts.
    Thinking of 'The Cello Song' (by Bach)
    
This is addressed more in the file called [beauty.md](beauty.md).
    
### Music sets the Atmosphere

>"They're not watching, the background.  They're not watching the actors.
>They're listening to the music." ~ George Lucas (Producing Episode 1 Podrace)

Watch a movie muted.  Feel the difference.

### Music vs Sounds

Sounds: When two things collide, they make a sound.  
Reverb: The distortion of a sound due to the environment, distance, and direction our ear is facing.
Music:  Actions performed for the sound.

### Song stuck in head

Factors that increase the likelihood that it will get stuck:

1. Simple
    1. 
1. We know it well
1. It is emotionally stimulating. (Good or bad - irritating or exhilarating)
1. Flowing (Not too choppy. Not too much variation)
    1. Even tempo (Just a guess)
    1. Repetitive
    1. Each section *leads into* the next.  
    
    
    The effect: Like any music, it sets the atmosphere.
    This can be positive if it has a motivating rhythm.
    
   
### High or Low Level?

##### Listening
Listening to music is usually a high level cognitive process.  Distracting unless it is congruent enough to merge with your current experience/train-of-thought.  Which is probably rare if ever.

##### Remembering
Remembering music can be a background-high-level activity.  It is easier than listening because it will switch off if you actually start thinking about something else.  And typically come back once your train-of-though stalls for a minute.  Like a low priority thread.
   
### Distracting

* We describe tones as "high" and "low". 
* Sound effects in cartoons are a great ~~annoyance~~ example of "music" reflecting the physical experience.
* Therefore, if it conflicts with the experience, it is distracting.

Example: Studying with music.  If the music is rapturous, it will steal the show (attention).
It will start producing "high" and "low" feelings.  (Remember that tactile and visual high-low may be
distilled to the same experience in memory*.  It is this experience that music is playing)

*My memory of "high" feels like a blob, slightly above my head, and to the right.
Now that I think about it, its almost like my right fist, as far up and back as I can reach it.

### Where do the feelings come from

    They may be hard coded, but if not, here are some guesses, using low-high sweep as the test case:
    
* Hands down is low, up high is high.
* Birds fly and make high sounds.
* Rocks dropping make low sounds.
* Playing piano is high on the right side.  So I tend to imagine high sounds over there.
* Stomping feet vs ringing ears
* Slow to fast. (Run a stick over a rock)

### Rhythm

Motivating.  Maybe relates to walking pace.

### Final Conclusions

##### What it does
* Harmony still makes no sense.
* Music plants abstract ideas in our heads. (Upward/downward/fast/slow/strong/soft)
* Music strongly influences our emotional state.

##### Why that is useful
* Helps motivate when needed.
* Helps creativity by presenting new mindsets.
* Outlet for communicating our feelings?
* Useful for suggesting the desired feelings for data we are presenting

##### Tone and Vocal Inflection
* Which came first, vocal inflection, or music?
* (Assuming one is mimicking the other)
