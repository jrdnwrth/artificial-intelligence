Dimensions
==========

### Touch gives us 3 dimensional signals.
    Example: Baby stick finger in wooden whole.
    
(At least it gives us adjectives for how 3 dimensional shapes *feel*)

### Sound gives us the time dimension.
    Example: Even when we see a repeating pattern, we hear the sequence in our heads.
    Example: Everything makes a sound.  Just ask a parent.

### Sight has both 2D and 3D inputs.
    Example: Things are much easier to recognize with two eyes instead of one, because
    it registers in 3 dimensions.
    Example: Many things are too far away for two eyes to perceive depth.

    The recognition_curvature.md explains that both 2D and 3D recognition
    algorithms may be running simultaneously.
    




Simplification
==============

> Helen Keller only had sight and hearing until 19 months.  Everything else she learned was completely by feeling. (Touch, but don't forget the effects of emotion.)
