Terminology
===========

**Sensory Reduction**: 

    Distilling complex input into simplified mental models for processing and storage.

**Multidimentional Hash**: 

    The 'gist' of an object or scene.  
    1. Used for recognizing a specific object.  
    2. Or recalling a similar object. 
Its purpose is *not* to provide specific information on the differences.
As stated, its purpose is to identify specific objects, or remember similar ones.
Higher level processes may use this information to:
1. identify faces, objects we own, familiar locations.
2. assume cause-effect relationships from similar objects.
    1. With the high level option of identifying specific differences before jumping to conclusions.
    

**Curvature Recognition**

    A reduction method for visual input. 
    
This is for *visual* input only.  Meaning it may not be needed if we drop visual input.
However, the *sweeping* over/around the object method of distilling its essence may apply to learning via touch.

**Low/High Level**: 
 
    Low Level: Unconcious mental function.

    Medium Level: Like breathing.  Automatic, until consciously controlled.
    
    High Level: Always affected by, or part of, the decision making process.
