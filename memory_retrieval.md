Memory Retrieval
================

1. Uniqueness
    * 
2. Triggers

Example: I took a trip to Mazama and crossed over the North Cascades Highway. 
We probably stopped at 8 different places. All of them very unique experiences.  
And 
But I can not recal any of it.  Not on my own.
Jaime has to describe a place we visited.  Then I remember all the details.  I just didn't know that *that*
was the Mazama trip.  And I don't remember where we went next.  I did not look at the map, just drove.
So she tells me where we went next.  But the place name does not cause me to recal anything.
Again, she has to describe it.
