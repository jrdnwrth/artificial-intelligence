Purpose
=======

I want to write a generic algorithm that identifies cause and effect relationships and influences them toward a desired state.

Pillars:
* Emotions
* Memory Map
* Language

Just copy my thought process as much as possible.
But don't be afraid to cheat by simplifying.

Format
======


Each topic is discussed in a separate file.  

To reference another topic do `[terms](terms.md)`

To (re)define a word, place it in the terms.md file.

Typically, I use a series of examples and conclusions when probing for answers:

### Examples

    given some situation
    this is the outcome

### Conclusions

    and this is why it works that way


Consider moving this to a Wiki.
