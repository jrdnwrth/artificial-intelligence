How do you recognize an object?
===============================

It, or one if its sub-components, resembles a previously viewed
and stored form(shape), texture, or movement (change in shape over time).

As previously stated, effects are applied to the possible remembered objects
to justify which is the most probable match.

### How do you identify objects that share effects?

* Effects that are observed and stored, are categorized 
so similar effects can be recalled.
* Each effect has a collection of associated objects.
* Objects are also stored in proximit to each other by similarity.
* If grouped (similar) effects are associated with objects that 
are similar* then this similarity is a theory for the effect.
* Other objects with this similarity are then assumed to share the effect.
* (Simply find the characteristics that match best between the objects)

*Side Note: I think the main piece I was missing when I wrote this
was that the objects could be distilled into a composition of feelings,
**before** performing these comparisons.  Which makes everything above
much easier to code.*

### Phase 1

    This is phase 1 of object recognition: The proximity phase.

**objects**:*asymmetrical, bulbous, clean rough, wet, forked, curvy,
brightness, hue, saturation, soft, heavy, large, spindly, motion (*expand this one*)
