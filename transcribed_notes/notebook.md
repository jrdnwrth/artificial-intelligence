Material World
==============

* Cause and effect relationships are always answered by sing the Why? (or How?) question.
* The why question is always answered using time, space, and matter.
* AI must develop in a material world.

### Object Recognition

Objects can be in collections of other objects, 
given a simplified definition => shape, texture, motion.

    Textures, shape, and motion are used to identify like-objects.

**Texture**: spindly, forking, repeating, shapes

**Motion**: 

Use shape and texture feelings to bring up memories of like objects (Hash).
This is the second level of identification. 

### Context

    What objecst are arount it

### Active Reasoning

### How do types of objects effect other objects?

*The text below was the best I could make of my scribbles.  Makes no sense...*

Effects get a generalized summary of the effects their collection of objects.
It may obtain a new effect that more of the peices contain.
