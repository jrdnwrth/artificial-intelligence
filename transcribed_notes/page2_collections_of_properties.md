Collections of Properties
=========================

### How are collections of properties identified?

They cahnge together fairly often.
Therefor, used as default parameters observed in effects.
They change each other fairly often.

Hierarchies can be created by grouping properties by how statisticallyl likely they will change together

```
T=1: Always change together.
T=0.5: Half of the time.
T=0.25: Quarter of the time.
T=0.125: ...
```
```
T=1:  (finger, finger, finger, thumb)            (toe, toe, heel)
                                \                   /
T=0.5:                         (hand,             foot)
                                    \              /
T=0.25:                               (whole body)

Half the time, if the foot gets hot, the hand gets hot too.
Or, half the time, if the foot moves, the hand moves too.
