### Heirarchy of Composition

When thinking about an object, not all details are present.  Just the essentials.

1. For example, ask someone to draw a crowd:  You will get a bunch of stick people.  With just heads in the back rows.
1. Ask someone to draw a person: You may get a stick person with the addition of a shirt and pants and smiley face.
1. Ask them to draw a face: ears, nose, and hair may be added to the face.
1. Ask them to draw an eye: probably recieving a football outline with a black circle inset.


### Curvature Recognition Idea #1

Render the image using a edge detection, so we only draw the edges.

The point at which we are looking, draw a circle.  Expand the circle
to encompass the entire image.  When edges from the environment cross
the circle, this makes a point.  The motion of these points is what 
we register and is what we use to remember and recognize like-objects.

For example: A picture frame is a square. All squares viewed by this method
will appear as one point that splits into two, which diverge then comes back
at a steady rate.

Note that this happens for every frame. 

There are other versions that may work as well:
1. don't use a circle, but use eye movement. 
1. Or, start a point at the closest corner of the object
to the center of our field of view (or field of focus)
and draw a circle that grows bigger.   Where it crosses
the edges of the object place points.  Track the points movement.

* A 3D version of this should probably run simultaneously.



How specific is our low-brain recognition?
==========================================

### How much do we really remember?
Low brain recognition has two parts:
1. Recognize that a specific object has been modified.
1. Have enough similarity to *remind* us of the object.

### To test for specific object modification:
1. Look at an object.  Then look away.
    1. Give it a good look over, but try to disengage your high-brain
    from remembering specifics*.
1. Have someone remove or alter part of it.
    1. This is easier with pictures than actual objects.
1. Look back at it.
    1. Can you tell if something changed?
    1. What changed?
        1. Your impressions are the key.

### To test for reminder of an object.
1. Choose 3 similar objects.
    1. Show them to subject A. 
    1. Then hide them for the remainder of the test.
1. Have subject B draw a corner of one of them.
1. Show subject A the drawing and ask if it reminds them of any of the three.

The banana picture I drew for Ava (just a few curved lines)
was all she needed for her mind to link it to 'bananas'.

Other Tests could include 
* taking a close up image. 
* Inverting the colors.
* Only rendering only the outline.
    * only the inside


*Remembering specifics (high-brain)
===================================
Example:
1. Counting items
1. Noting color
    1. Usually this is a mental word 'pink'
    1. Although I think we can note it without knowing the word.
1. 3D form or curves
    1. Again, easiest as a sentence:
        1. [The vase] "widens slightly near the top".
    1. But usually is not words.  But enough of an idea that we could
    construct a sentence later.
1. Etc.

Remembering non-specifics (low-brain)
=====================================
### Apple Slice Example:
1. Ava saw an enlarged picture of an apple slice on the side of a
costco box. 
1. She was holding an apple slice.  And she exclaimed "It matches!" 

### Conclusions
1. I'm assuming this was an automatic recognition (so low brain).
1. Meaning low-brain does some recognitions.

Low vs High Brain recognition
=============================
* Initial guess is that most recognition is low brain.
* But high brain can analyze the remembered similarities to 
confirm or deny that the objects are the same.

This leads us back to the question, "what is automatic?"
