Recognition - General
=====================

Decompose view before saving to memory
======================================

*Just the essence of the object.*

### Why?

1. Recognition. 
	* If we see a similar object, we want to be able to apply all cause-effect relationships to this new *similar* object.
1. 

Try one of these, or a combo
1. Into primitive shapes
	1. These can be learned shapes, rather than pre-loaded.
1. Into curves
	1. The outlines. Childrens' schetches are good examples:
		* Stick figures
		* Smiley faces
		* Houses, trees, hands, feet, bird, dog, horse.
1. Other possibilities:
	* Shading like the fill tool.
	* Composition by feelings
		* For example, spider clips for hair. Large end with many stringy curved legs extending in the same direction.  So you have a big blob on one side smoothly morphing into intricacies on the other side.  That is all most people will recall.  I would put money on this actually being the way things are stored.  This makes it very easy to recognize a wide variety of designs as all being spider clips.  (Not that size does not matter)

Simplifications
===============

Scale is arbitrary, so a cave and a thimble may have the same feelings
except for scale.

Recognition can happen at any resolution.  So maybe run the algorithms
on a 16x16 pixel reduction of the image, then 32x32.  Like mip-mapping.

Visual input only needs to be full-resolution in the center of the image, 
where we are looking.

Test Case
=========

Take a robot with 2 wheels.
Mount a camera on its belly facing down.
Place it on a famous painting.
Teach it beauty.
It will not know how to use the wheels, it has to learn this.

Its motivators will be beauty and discovery.
