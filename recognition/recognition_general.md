Recognition - General
=====================

Decompose view before saving to memory
======================================

*Just the essence of the object.*

### Why?

1. Recognition. 
	* If we see a similar object, we want to be able to apply all cause-effect relationships to this new *similar* object.
1. 



Try one of these, or a combo
1. Into primitive shapes
	1. These can be learned shapes, rather than pre-loaded.
1. Into curves
	1. The outlines. Childrens' schetches are good examples:
		* Stick figures
		* Smiley faces
		* Houses, trees, hands, feet, bird, dog, horse.
1. Other possibilities:
	* Shading like the fill tool.
	* Composition by feelings
		* For example, spider clips for hair. Large end with many stringy curved legs extending in the same direction.  So you have a big blob on one side smoothly morphing into intricacies on the other side.  That is all most people will recall.  I would put money on this actually being the way things are stored.  This makes it very easy to recognize a wide variety of designs as all being spider clips.  (Not that size does not matter)
