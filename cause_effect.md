Cause-Effect
============

    Cause and effect relationships are called 'Theories'.
    Theories may or may not be true.
    Theories will change to match experience.

### Pen-Drop Scenario
Use this as an example situation viewed by the AI, and determine what the AI should gain (learn) from this experience.
AI Experience: Pen-drop --> Noise
TODO: Transcribe notes from work.
TODO: Transcribe other notes.

##### Cause -> Effect learned:
    General -> Specific

    (General) Blob that stops suddely causes:
    (Specific) The sound of a plastic pen hitting a wooden table.

>If this theory does not prove true next time, then refine it by:
1. Narrowing the Cause (more specific)
1. Generalizing the Effect (more general)

Methods
1. What effects *are* repeatable?  Throw out what is not repeatable.  Save what is.
1. Best theories are general causes with specific effects. (and repeatable).
    1. Because they can be useful in making predictions in a *variety* of situations.
1. Split into two theories.  One general, the other specific.
1. Split into 4 (or more) theories. Throw out the theories that do not repeat.
    * G -> G : blob motion changes -> makes noise.    
    * G -> S : blob motion changes -> makes pen drop noise.
    * S -> G : pen shape stops on table -> makes noise.
    * S -> S : pen shape stops on table -> makes pen drop noise.
    
    
Combining Theories
==================

### Adding Theories
Prediction: Hit tamborine on table -> Hear both noises.

### Subtracting Theories
Prediction: Hit drumstick on pillow -> No sound.

Chaining Theories
=================

A -> B -> C -> D -> E

Have the ability to condense these to 

A -> E

You may need to compile all the required states from A through E into this summary cause-effect relationship.


Example one:  Waving a pen did NOT produce the expected sound.


Example two:  Dropping the pen produces many different sounds, sometimes repeating (bounce).
