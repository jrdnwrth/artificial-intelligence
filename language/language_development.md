Language Development
====================

### Example Word: "Charcoal"

Ava learns about "charcoal" facemask.
Compare to my learning of charcoal.



### Example Word: "Duplicate"

This word can be a noun, verb, or adjective. 
In the examples below, "duplicate" can be replaced with "red"
(just to give an example of another word) to change the meaning
of the sentences.  But the sentences still make sense.

### Conclusions

##### Adjectives, Verbs, and Nouns are all properties 
"Douplicate" (or "red" as another example) is not a verb, noun,
or adjective - but simply a property.
* If we are talking about the property itself, then its a **noun**.
* If we are describing an object by that property, its an **adjective**.
* If we talk about altering that property of an object, then it is a **verb**.

##### Properties are simple observations.

##### Let language be sloppy.
* Consider toddler-speak.  Very sloppy. Short. But usually makes plenty of sense.
    * For example, 'T' and 'K' make choppy noises and may be interchangeable.
* Even the sentence "I want to 'red' that table." Makes sense to mean "Color it red".


##### TO SORT
If two ways produce the same outcome, mind tends to follow both. Example
* Vim hotkeys.  
    * One key moves the cursor up. The other inserts a line *above* the current line.  I
tend to do them both, resulting in a new line *too high*.
* Racing game. 
    * When the track splits, it is hard to commit to one side,
rather than splitting the difference (and hitting the barrier).
