Modeling
========

### Summary

>How one thinks. Simplifying the real-world into building blocks.  So we can design ideas. In pictures? Verbally?  
Run through scenarios to see if they play out to our favor.

### Curves  
    I am convinced that it comes down to curves.  2D or 3D (surfaces)?

### Examples
> Describing the word 'ditch' to a kid.  He will likely respond, "Ok, like a gutter!?"  (Thinking of bowling)
