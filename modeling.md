Modeling
========

### Summary

>How one thinks. Simplifying the real-world into building blocks.  So we can design ideas. In pictures? Verbally?  
Run through scenarios to see if they play out to our favor.

### Curves  
    I am convinced that it comes down to curves.  2D or 3D (surfaces)?

### Examples
##### Ditch
    Describing the word 'ditch' to a young kid.  
    He will likely respond, "Ok, like a gutter!?"  (Thinking of bowling)

##### Analysis
1. First, the description of a ditch.  Possibilities:
    1. "A trough that runs along the side of the road."
    1. "When the dirt beside the road goes down then up again <*while drawing a 'U' shape in the air*> "
1. This becomes a 'Mental Image'
1. This mental image is stored.
1. This mental image relates to at least one other mental image (a bowling gutter).
1. Therefor, the bowling gutter memory must have been saved in a similar location.

Interesting how the description of a ditch, and the real-life experience of a bowling gutter **find the same location in memory*.
*Or are somehow related.  My theory is that that the real world experience is distilled into adjective-like components.
Of course, actual adjectives are words that are ascociated with real-world experiences.  They are the names for our
we have distilled the experiences.  The real question is: "What is the distilled experience?"...

Shapes?  Sounds?  Feelings?  Probably a combo of curvature and emotional recognition.
