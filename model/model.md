The Model
========

### Summary

>How one thinks. Simplifying the real-world into building blocks.  So we can design ideas. In pictures? Verbally?  
Run through scenarios to see if they play out to our favor.

### Purpose

Many algorithms will be much more manageable applied to a simplified view of reality.
Such as applying learned cause-effect theories to new objects.  I don't know how to write
an algorithm to do that using purely raw data.  But if what we are viewing
is already interpreted as a "long, small, object", then I can easilly apply the
assumption that gravity will make it drop. 

### Curves  
    I am convinced that it comes down to curves.  2D or 3D (surfaces)?

### Examples
##### Ditch
    Describing the word 'ditch' to a young kid.  
    He will likely respond, "Ok, like a gutter!?"  (Thinking of bowling)

##### Analysis
1. First, the description of a ditch.  Possibilities:
    1. "A trough that runs along the side of the road."
    1. "When the dirt beside the road goes down then up again <*while drawing a 'U' shape in the air*> "
1. This becomes a 'Mental Image'
1. This mental image is stored.
1. This mental image relates to at least one other mental image (a bowling gutter).
1. Therefor, the bowling gutter memory must have been saved in a similar location.

Interesting how the description of a ditch, and the real-life experience of a bowling gutter **find the same location in memory*.
*Or are somehow related.  My theory is that that the real world experience is distilled into adjective-like components.
Of course, actual adjectives are words that are ascociated with real-world experiences.  They are the names for our
we have distilled the experiences.  The real question is: "What is the distilled experience?"...

Shapes?  Sounds?  Feelings?  Probably a combo of curvature and emotional recognition.

Pragmatism
==========
This is overly philosophical, but pretty close to what I am doing:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism
"Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. 
Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object."
    
    Means a "Cliff" is actually a "Falling off place."
    Or maybe a "Cup" is a "liquid holder".
    Or maybe a "Car" is a "self-propelled, stearable, people transporter"
    
Basically a thing *is* what it *does*.

This does not seem to be the only way we think.  But it emphasises the main emotion tied
to objects.  And it explains why creating abstract solutions is so easy; for example, if
we need to hold water, we don't require an object called "cup". Rather we need something
that fulfills the feeling of "liquid holder".  It could be a recess in the floor.  Or a 
concave leaf.

The Model and The Senses
====================
We create a mental model to form ideas and solve problems.

Hopefully, the model we create uses all our sense with great detail. Remember the study-skills
exercise to imagine "There is a horse and you."

The model, like all experiences, is remembered by its senses, feelings, and intensity.

The more specific the model, the longer until it is forgotten.
Meaning we can attach more mental models together before they fall apart (are forgotten).

The Model and Language
======================
Remember Helen Keller needed language. Almost equating it with consciousness. Even though she
could still learn and play games prior to language.  Interesting...
    
### For Remembering the Model
For this same reason (remembering the model), I like writing my thoughts.  Especially when
I didn't get much sleep (or the subject is boring) and my train of thought keeps derailing.

### For Forming(Solidifying) the Model
Words help form mental models.

##### Example 1: 
    If I say "Each account is tied to many services.", then the word "tied" triggers (solidifies)
    the idea of a bunch of ropes connected to an account with services at the other end.
    
##### Example 2: 
    During a meeting, someone used (and defined) the term "greenfield".  They used it to 
    refer to a plan that involved 'rebuilding the current system from scratch', as apposed
    to developing a new and unique system.  The new term was used throughout the rest of 
    the meeting.  In this example, the model is not useful for simulating, but it is very good
    at bookmarking the idea that was presented.  Like a handle we could all use.  A name.
    It made it memorable (by being a visual stimulating) with enough similarities to the
    actual idea that we could remember what it referred to.

Multiple Stimuli can result in the Same Model
=============================================
Example 1: E and e are nearly the same in my mind: even though they look completely different.

Example 2: A person's face from the front looks entirely different than from the side.
But we think of the same person.
