Origin
======

I am in the center of my environment.
When I move, my environment shifts, not me.

But that is just by default. I can turn off my eyes, 
and imagine what I look like crossing the parking lot
to someone sitting in their car. 

Mirror Neurons
==============

My 9 month old mimics waving when she sees us do it.

This can only work if we can *imagine how to perform the gesture ourselves*.
It doesn't have to be accurate/correct. Just that we can imagine it.

Put ourselves in someone else's shoes
====================================

This usually works best if we actually imagine them as the origin,
and imagine seeing the world from that angle.
But again, we have to tune out our world.
This aligns with the single-high-level-thread theory.

Feeling of Distance
===================

We can scale things in our minds.

Feeling a bowl, then imagining it the size of a crater.

What is distance or the feeling of far away?

Is it the feeling of something just within our grasp, time 10?
