Creating Adjectives
===================

    Objects are composed of feelings.  Our feelings about them. 
    These are 'adjectives'.

### How are new adjectives created?

Remember that *whole* objects are composed of multiple adjectives.
Therefore an adjective may be created from just a small section,
of an object.  Some feature.  It could be a texture on the object,
or some moving attached piece that seems unique (new to us).

Movement plays a big part in recognition and generating adjectives.

Beauty
======

Beauty is unexplainable.  Some things we like because of reasons.
Somethings we like because we like them.  They are **hard-wired**.

Hard-Wired: The sound of the ocean. Sunrises and sunset.  A bon-fire. 
The sight and sound of water flowing over rocks in a creek.  
Fluffy snow on a forest. Christmas tree lights in a dark room.  Candles.  
Music. Attractive faces. A smile. Laughter.

Even though we develop an affinity or distaste for everything we encounter, 
some things are just innately (initially) desireable.

(Note that we may develop a distaste for one of these good things if
we associate it with bad experiences.)

(Note that there may also be an opposite equivalent, like a hard-wired
fear of spiders)

(Note that the hard-wired "good" feeling we feel is unique
for each of these experiences. So don't be tricked into simply using 
a 'likeableness' scaler variable.  Better to use several dimensions, 
at the simplest.  And give each a unique pattern.)

This may solve the problem described below:

Without hardwiring beauty, then we are left with only one positive
feedback - success/progress.  And this is rarely bestowed, especially on the learner

In infancy, this is rarely achieved.  Leaving everything with a "bad taste in our mouth"
Meaning everything will be disliked.  And no adjectives can be learned
with a positive association.

Leading to my theory: adjectives are our feelings tied to properties of objects.

If we had a good experience while learning the new ajective (property) then
we will like it.  If it was bad, then it will be a bad adjective.

This will need some fleshing out.
