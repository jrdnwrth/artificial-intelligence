Creating Adjectives
===================

    Objects are composed of feelings.  Our feelings about them. 
    These are 'adjectives'.

### How are new adjectives created?

Remember that *whole* objects are composed of multiple adjectives.
Therefore an adjective may be created from just a small section,
of an object.  Some feature.  It could be a texture on the object,
or some moving attached piece that seems unique (new to us).

Movement plays a big part in recognition and generating adjectives.

Beauty and Motivation
=====================
Beauty is a longing or desire, not a satisfaction.

Beauty is unexplainable.  Some things we like because of reasons.
Somethings we like because we like them.  They are **hard-wired**.
By 'we like them' I mean they make us feel good.

Hard-Wired: The sound of the ocean. Sunrises and sunset.  A bon-fire. 
The sight and sound of water flowing over rocks in a creek.  
Fluffy snow on a forest. Christmas tree lights in a dark room.  Candles.  
Music. Attractive faces. A smile. Laughter. Complex drum beats. 

Even though we develop an affinity or distaste for everything we encounter, 
some things are just innately (initially) desireable.

(Note that we may develop a distaste for one of these good things if
we associate it with bad experiences.)

(Note that there may also be an opposite equivalent, like a hard-wired
fear of spiders)

(Note that the hard-wired "good" feeling we feel is unique
for each of these experiences. So don't be tricked into simply using 
a 'likeableness' scaler variable.  Better to use several dimensions, 
at the simplest.  And give each a unique pattern.)

This may solve the problem described below:

Without hardwiring beauty, then we are left with only these for positive
feedback - success(progress) and discovery(learning) and control(over our environment)

(Success and Control might be the same thing.  Not sure yet)

Success is rarely bestowed in the very early stages of learning.
Discovery is very common in the very early stages of learning.
However, both are very different feelings than beauty found in music, for example.

To create adjectives, we need more than success and discovery to shape our
preferential feelings toward them.  This is where beauty fills the role
of helping us differentiate objects.

I *like* blue and stripes. But dislike spidery shapes.  So a blue spider hair clip
is going to give me very mixed emotions.  This emotion is very unique to 
that particular object.  And helps me identify it.

Note that what we *like* may not simply be raw input, but rather 
what we imagine it to be.  In other words, the distilled model* in our mind.
This is also where we will recognize something as *new*, ie, a discovery. And enjoyable.

    *As a low level example, if I imagine that the reflection of an island in a lake is simply 
    like a shadow, but more colorful, then it may seem boring. Not eliciting much emotion.
    But if I think of the reflection as the whole world existing upside-down beneath the 
    water's surface, then it may *feel* vastly more interesting.

    As a high level example, this whole project of creating an AI is only intriguing because
    1. It has never been done before.
    2. I do not know the outcome.
    I am *imagining* (expecting) discovery.  
    Even if I am not experiencing discovery, yet. 
    
    (Ok, yes there are micro-discoveries and successes along the way.)
    
    One more example: Diamonds. If I saw a diamond, and did not know it was *real*, 
    then I may not take much note of it.  However, if I mentally register its rarity, 
    it will poses a very different feeling.

In infancy, success and control are rarely achieved.  So without beauty and discovery,
every experience would leave a "bad taste in our mouth".  Which would then be tied to the 
objects we were handling. (Sucking on, usually)
Meaning everything would be disliked initially.  So no adjectives would be learned
with a positive association.

Leading to my theory: adjectives are our feelings tied to like-properties of objects.
These feelings are an accumulation of each experience with that property.

If we had a good experience while learning the new adjective (property) then
we will like it.  If it was bad, then it will be a bad adjective.

This is combined with our initialized feelings of beauty toward it, 
and/or fear of it (spiders, snakes),
as well as the thrill of discovery and *new-ness*.

Viewing/experiencing the object/adjective may also conjure full past memories of the object/adjective.

Human Motivation - (put this in a separate file)
=========================
### Motivations in *daily* life
Note that these are only effective when shared with others.  
Put a person in indefinite isolation and their motivation is extinguished. 
(Even the hope of eventually sharing with others is enough to keep going.)

I think these are hard-wired into people:

1. discovery and beauty

    Beauty is often "seeing something new, rare, or in a new light".  New implies discovery.
    I don't know if beauty is ever found separate from the sense of discovery.

2. to create and perfect

    We get satisfaction out of improving something.
    Or making it from scratch.
    Or finding the most elegant/efficient/impressive solution to a problem.
    Or perfecting a skateboarding trick.
    
3. empathy vs dominance
                        
    We like to lift up the weak/poor. We want everyone to be happy. 
    But we also like to dominate the strong. 
    We want to be important/valued in other people's eyes.
    
##### Definitions
* Discovery: Learning/experiencing something new. Out of the ordinary.
* Beauty: Any external stimuli that stimulates emotion. Usually positive. Sunset. Music. Fireworks.
* To Create: I left my mark on the world. I turned something ordinary into something beautiful or interesting (aka "new" aka "discovery")
* To Perfect: Discovering the maximum potential of something or someone or myself. (Note the word "discovering")
* Empathy: Mirror neurons. I see that person as myself, and feel their feelings. This include child-rearing.  I want someone to be happy.
* Dominance: I want power/control/popularity/respect/attention/success etc. 

### FAQ
    I just want more money.
"More money" meaning relative to the next guy? You just want more respect. AKA "dominance"

    I just want to collect more lumber. It feels good to have it.
"Because it opens up possibilities to 'create' things?  Because it is beautiful?  
Because it is rare? (Discovery).  Because it makes us valuable?  These are my root motives.
All of these reasons are covered above."

    I feel bored. What does that mean?
Probably you are tired, or you don't want to do what you are supposed to be doing.

    Why do people enjoy watching sports?
Empathy and Dominance: They choose a player. They are that player. That player's successes are their successes. 
When the player dominates, they dominate. They buy the same jersey. They make a party and 
share it with others, so that it seems more real. Its weird. 

### If these motivations are hardwired, how are they determined?
I'm convinced that its just chemical drugs produced in the brain, determined by:

1. Sleep and Exercise 

    This is number 1 for a reason.
    I've found that when nothing sounds fun, it means that I need to go to sleep. 

1. Genetics 

    Anyone with children can attest to this.  People just feel different.

1. Food and Drugs

    Don't eat soy.

1. Skills, Perceived Success, Encouragement

    Am I doing something that I could enjoy, if it were going my way?
    I expect that even plumbing a house would be fun if I felt 
    like I was really good at it and had the tools.

1. Historical Dispositions

    If you've had bad experiences with swimming as a sport, then you probably wont like it.
    So don't expect to be motivated to do a charity swim.
    
1. Luck 

    Are all your co-workers illiterate when it comes to programming, so they think you have magical powers?
    Or do you work with experts and lag behind them endlessly?
    Some situations set us up for success.  Some don't.
    
1. Self-Talk

    Be on your own side.
    
1. The Feedback Loop

    If I loath my job, then I will drag out the evening so tomorrow doesn't come.
    Meaning I don't get the sleep I need and tomorrow is harder than it should be.
    
    If I am on a role and making progress on a project, then I am encouraged and
    don't look for distractions or escapes.  My energy and efficiency remain high.

### Motivations - Long Term
Why do we get out of bed in the morning?

#### Naturalistic View:
It is neither good nor bad to get out of bed. People who are motivated to live and reproduce are no
better than those who chose not to.  They are simply the ones who are still here.

#### Religious View:
To get to heaven. Obedience to God out of gratitude for his love.

Concave Feeling
===============

    How is it created?  
    
Is this from the same mechanism that registers beauty?  It could be.
For example, just as beauty is hardwired, a whole range of feeling 
could be hard coded depending on the input.

Or this could be similar to the curve feelings, but in 3 dimensions.

Maybe the concave feeling is created by imagining yourself as an ant
inside the concave cavity and feeling the walls all around us.  

There is no rule that we have to imagine ourselves to-scale.
