Creating Adjectives
===================

    Objects are composed of feelings.  Our feelings about them. 
    These are 'adjectives'.

### How are new adjectives created?

Remember that *whole* objects are composed of multiple adjectives.
Therefore an adjective may be created from just a small section,
of an object.  Some feature.  It could be a texture on the object,
or some moving attached piece that seems unique (new to us).

Movement plays a big part in recognition and generating adjectives.

Beauty and Motivation
=====================

Beauty is unexplainable.  Some things we like because of reasons.
Somethings we like because we like them.  They are **hard-wired**.
By 'we like them' I mean they make us feel good.

Hard-Wired: The sound of the ocean. Sunrises and sunset.  A bon-fire. 
The sight and sound of water flowing over rocks in a creek.  
Fluffy snow on a forest. Christmas tree lights in a dark room.  Candles.  
Music. Attractive faces. A smile. Laughter. Complex drum beats. 

Even though we develop an affinity or distaste for everything we encounter, 
some things are just innately (initially) desireable.

(Note that we may develop a distaste for one of these good things if
we associate it with bad experiences.)

(Note that there may also be an opposite equivalent, like a hard-wired
fear of spiders)

(Note that the hard-wired "good" feeling we feel is unique
for each of these experiences. So don't be tricked into simply using 
a 'likeableness' scaler variable.  Better to use several dimensions, 
at the simplest.  And give each a unique pattern.)

This may solve the problem described below:

Without hardwiring beauty, then we are left with only these for positive
feedback - success(progress) and discovery(learning) and control(over our environment)

(Success and Control might be the same thing.  Not sure yet)

Success is rarely bestowed in the very early stages of learning.
Discovery is very common in the very early stages of learning.
However, both are very different feelings than beauty found in music, for example.

To create adjectives, we need more than success and discovery to shape our
preferential feelings toward them.  This is where beauty fills the role
of helping us differentiate objects.

I *like* blue and stripes. But dislike spidery shapes.  So a blue spider hair clip
is going to give me very mixed emotions.  This emotion is very unique to 
that particular object.  And helps me identify it.

Note that what we *like* may not simply be raw input, but rather 
what we imagine it to be.  In other words, the distilled model* in our mind.
This is also where we will recognize something as *new*, ie, a discovery. And enjoyable.

    *As a low level example, if I imagine that the reflection of an island in a lake is simply 
    like a shadow, but more colorful, then it may seem boring. Not eliceting much emotion.
    But if I think of the reflection as the whole world existing upside-down beneath the 
    water's surface, then it may *feel* vastly more interesting.

    As a high level example, this whole project of creating an AI is only intreguing because
    1. It has never been done before.
    2. I do not know the outcome.
    I am *imagining* (expecting) discovery.  
    Even if I am not experiencing discovery, yet. 
    
    (Ok, yes there are micro-discoveries and successes along the way.)
    
    One more example: Diamonds. If I saw a diamond, and did not know it was *real*, 
    then I may not take much note of it.  However, if I mentally register its rarity, 
    it will posess a very different feeling.

In infancy, success and control are rarely achieved.  So without beauty and discovery,
every experience would leave a "bad taste in our mouth".  Which would then be tied to the 
objects we were handling. (Sucking on, usually)
Meaning everything would be disliked initially.  So no adjectives would be learned
with a positive association.

Leading to my theory: adjectives are our feelings tied to like-properties of objects.
These feelings are an accumulation of each experience with that property.

If we had a good experience while learning the new adjective (property) then
we will like it.  If it was bad, then it will be a bad adjective.

This is combined with our initialized feelings of beauty toward it, 
and/or fear of it (spiders, snakes),
as well as the thrill of discovery and *new-ness*.

Viewing/experiencing the object/adjective may also conjure full past memories of the object/adjective.

Concave feeling
===============

    How is it created?  
    
Is this from the same mechanism that registers beauty?  It could be.
For example, just as beauty is hardwired, a whole range of feeling 
coulde be hard coded depending on the input.

Or this could be similar to the curve feelings, but in 3 dimensions.

Maybe the concave feeling is created by imagining yourself as an ant
inside the concave cavity and feeling the walls all around us.  

There is no rule that we have to imagine ourselves to-scale.
