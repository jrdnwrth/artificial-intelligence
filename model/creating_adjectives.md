Creating Adjectives
===================

    Objects are composed of feelings.  Our feelings about them. These are 'adjectives'.

### How are new adjectives created?

Remember that *whole* objects are composed of multiple adjectives.
Therefore an adjective may be created from just a small section,
of an object.  Some feature.  It could be a texture on the object,
or some moving attached piece that seems unique (new to us).

Movement plays a big part in recognition and generating adjectives.
