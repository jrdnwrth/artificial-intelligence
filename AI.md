I want to write a generic algorithm that identifies cause and effect relationships and influences them toward a desired state.

Decompose view before saving to memory
======================================

*Just the essense of the object.*

### Why?

1. Recognition. 
	* If we see a similar object, we want to be able to apply all cause-effect relationships to this new *similar* object.
1. 

### Pen-Drop Scenario
Use this as an example situation viewed by the AI, and determine what the AI should gain (learn) from this experience.
AI Experience: Pen-drop --> Noise
TODO: Transcribe notes from work.

### Degrees of Recognition
* Scenario
> When I look at a house (or a bike or a person), I may not recognize it as a house I have seen before, but I still recognize it as a house.
In other words, it falls under the broader category for house; but does not land close enough to any *hashes I recognize as a specific house.

* Explanation
> The best explanation is similar to the one I built a long time ago. I will call it the Multidimentional Hash (MH).
I am not sure how all the pieces will fit together, but here are a few of the pieces.
* A snapshot of all the sense and feelings, at the moment in time when a house is viewed, will _combine_ to be the key in a hash.
Similar experiences should produce keys that are relatively close together. Such that all houses should produces keys in a certian range or region.
This may be more easily occomplished if the key is multidimentional. 
* Multidimensional: The most extreme version of this would be to create a dimension for every input. This could be hundreds of dimensions.
* I will recognize a picture of my house as my house.  However, I will know that it is not the real thing, since some dimensions are missing.
Only the visual dimentions of the key match my house.  The other dimensions are missing (actually, they just don't match).

* Scenario
> Houses can be recognized as simple stick drawing. With maybe 6 straight lines.  But to recognize it as *my* house, much more detail is required.

* Explanation
> The definition for House will ignore many of
To recognize *my* house, the experience (viewing a drawing usually) will need to generate a hash with enough dimensions matching the range of 
keys I have saved as *my house*.  There will be a variety of keys that all mean *my house*: The appearance from the front, vs the appearance from the back yard.

This is only to generate the *reminder* of my house.  Close inpection may reveal major differences between the house I am viewing and the real thing, which 
may lead me to the conclusion that it actually is *not* my house.  But this is a separate, higher-level, cognitive process.

> The purpose of this hash-key lookup is to present reminders of __similar__ experiences/objects.
That way we can apply the cause-effect relationships we've learned to the current situation.


Common shapes on a house are used to make the simplified 6-line house recognizable.

* Processing into feelings.  Use the feelings as additional dimensions in the hash key.

Note that this is recal. Not recognition.  This is the model we use when we are looking at the room around us and only interested in walking through it.  Actually I need to think through what this is for.  

Learn shapes in a real world.  Save a shapshot of all emotional inputs when viewing that shape.
That is the experience that is recalled when viewing that shape. 
That shape is now used when decomposing other objects into their components.
So the feeling of the final object will be a conglomeration of the feelings of each component.

For example, the spider-clip. We learn the basic shape of a spider.  Say our mom finds one and kills it.
That is usually an unsettling experience, for a learning toddler.  That is the shapes feeling: unsettling.
Now when a spider-hair clip is seen, it can be decomposed into a top blob, and a spidery base - with
an overall unsettling feeling about the hair clip.

Note that we don't need to decompose objects into squares and circles and triangles only;
any learned shape can be used.  Simpler shapes will be more frequently useful.  
Eifel tower vs pyrimid vs code.  Similar, but slightly different feelings.  Forget the underlying form,
they all just give similar, "concludes in a point" kind of feeling.  And the feeling is what links them. 


Try one of these, or a combo
1. Into primitive shapes
	1. These can be learned shapes, rather than pre-loaded.
1. Into curves
	1. The outlines. Childrens schetches are good examples:
		* Stick figures
		* Smiley faces
		* Houses, trees, hands, feet, bird, dog, horse.
1. Other possibilities:
	* Shading like the fill tool.
	* Composition by feelings
		* For example, spider clips for hair. Large end with many stringy curved legs extending in the same direction.  So you have a big blob on one side smoothly morphing into intricacies on the other side.  That is all most people will recall.  I would put money on this actually being the way things are stored.  This makes it very easy to recognize a wide variety of designs as all being spider clips.  (Not that size does not matter)

### Heirarchy of Composition

When thinking about an object, not all details are present.  Just the essentials.

1. For example, ask someone to draw a crowd:  You will get a bunch of stick people.  With just heads in the back rows.
1. Ask someone to draw a person: You may get a stick person with the addition of a shirt and pants and smiley face.
1. Ask them to draw a face: ears, nose, and hair may be added to the face.
1. Ask them to draw an eye: probably recieving a football outline with a black circle inset.





Viewing Examples:
Viewing a bird (not in flight):  Small, hard, pointed end. Sweeping (aerodynamic) curves around a soft, larger body, ending in a long thin or squared off tail.

Simplifications

Cause-Effect Chain Shortcuts
============================

A -> B -> C -> D -> E

Have the ability to condense these to 

A -> E

You may need to compile all the required states from A through E into this summary cause-effect relationship.
