Test push

I want to write a generic algorithm that identifies cause and effect relationships and influences them toward a desired state.

Decompose view before saving to memory
======================================

*Just the essense of the object.*

### Why?

1. Recognition. 
	* If we see a similar object, we want to be able to apply all cause-effect relationships to this new *similar* object.
1. 

### Pen-Drop Scenario
Use this as an example situation viewed by the AI, and determine what the AI should gain (learn) from this experience.
AI Experience: Pen-drop --> Noise

Try one of these, or a combo
1. Into primitive shapes
	1. These can be learned shapes, rather than pre-loaded.
1. Into curves
	1. The outlines. Childrens schetches are good examples:
		* Stick figures
		* Smiley faces
		* Houses, trees, hands, feet, bird, dog, horse.
1. Other possibilities:
	* Shading like the fill tool.
	* Composition by feelings
		* For example, spider clips for hair. Large end with many stringy curved legs extending in the same direction.  So you have a big blob on one side smoothly morphing into intricacies on the other side.  That is all most people will recall.  I would put money on this actually being the way things are stored.  This makes it very easy to recognize a wide variety of designs as all being spider clips.  (Not that size does not matter)







Simplifications
===============


Cause-Effect Chain Shortcuts
============================

A -> B -> C -> D -> E

Have the ability to condense these to 

A -> E

You may need to compile all the required states from A through E into this summary cause-effect relationship.
