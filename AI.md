I want to write a generic algorithm that identifies cause and effect relationships and influences them toward a desired state.

Decompose view before saving to memory
======================================

*Just the essence of the object.*

### Why?

1. Recognition. 
	* If we see a similar object, we want to be able to apply all cause-effect relationships to this new *similar* object.
1. 

### Pen-Drop Scenario
Use this as an example situation viewed by the AI, and determine what the AI should gain (learn) from this experience.
AI Experience: Pen-drop --> Noise

##### Cause -> Effect learned:
    *General* -> Specific

    (General) Black blob that stops suddely causes:
    (Specific) the sound of a plastic pen hitting a wooden table.

>If this theory does not prove true next time, then refine it by:
1. Narrowing the Cause (more specific)
1. Generalizing the Effect (more general)

Methods
1. What effects *are* repeatable?  Throw out what is not repeatable.  Save what is.
1. Best theories are general causes with specific effects. (and repeatable).
    1. Because they can be useful in making predictions in a *variety* of situations.
1. Split into two theories.  One general, the other specific.
1. Split into 4 (or more) theories. Throw out the theories that do not repeat.
    * G -> G : blob motion changes -> makes noise.    
    * G -> S : blob motion changes -> makes pen drop noise.
    * S -> G : pen shape stops on table -> makes noise.
    * S -> S : pen shape stops on table -> makes pen drop noise.
    
    
Combining Theories
==================

### Adding Theories
Prediction: Hit tamborine on table -> Hear both noises.

### Subtracting Theories
Prediction: Hit drumstick on pillow -> No sound.

Chaining Theories
=================

A -> B -> C -> D -> E

Have the ability to condense these to 

A -> E

You may need to compile all the required states from A through E into this summary cause-effect relationship.


Example one:  Waving a pen did NOT produce the expected sound.


Example two:  Dropping the pen produces many different sounds, sometimes repeating (bounce).



Try one of these, or a combo
1. Into primitive shapes
	1. These can be learned shapes, rather than pre-loaded.
1. Into curves
	1. The outlines. Childrens' schetches are good examples:
		* Stick figures
		* Smiley faces
		* Houses, trees, hands, feet, bird, dog, horse.
1. Other possibilities:
	* Shading like the fill tool.
	* Composition by feelings
		* For example, spider clips for hair. Large end with many stringy curved legs extending in the same direction.  So you have a big blob on one side smoothly morphing into intricacies on the other side.  That is all most people will recall.  I would put money on this actually being the way things are stored.  This makes it very easy to recognize a wide variety of designs as all being spider clips.  (Not that size does not matter)
